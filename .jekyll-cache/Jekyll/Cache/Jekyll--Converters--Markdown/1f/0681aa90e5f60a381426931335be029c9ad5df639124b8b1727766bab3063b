I"Å<p>When I was much younger a friend gave me a book titled â€œThe Stories of Ibisâ€ by Hiroshi Yamamoto, saying â€œyou like computers, youâ€™ll love this!â€
I was already cemented in my path to do software so I gobbled up any techy fiction that came my way. And boy did this deliver. While I read some older sci-fi like Asimov in the local library, something about the stories in the book deeply resonated with me and I think about the book often.</p>

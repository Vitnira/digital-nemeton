I"q<p>Whenever religious discussions come up on the internet I have to summarize my beliefs since they don’t fall into any category nicely. I want to make it clear I’m NOT actively avoiding categorization to be a Cool Hipster, if something ready-made already worked I’d use that. Nothing does though.</p>

<p>Let me first explain my “goals” for spiritual belief. Reading Jung, philosophers, and modern scientific studies has convinced me that humans need to have spiritual beliefs. The need is so strong that in its absense, something approximating belief will be constructed. Another way of putting it - I do not believe humans can truly be atheist or agnostic. Everyone has gods, everyone has something they have Faith in beyond Reason. Most “atheists” worship Scientific Materialism. The scientists are priests, published papers unquestionable doctrine. Sometimes they worship Communism. Some worship other forms of radical politics, with Faith that if only their god would manifest on earth, the world would be perfect.</p>

<p>So knowing that I have Faith the question then becomes: What do I have Faith in, and what SHOULD I have Faith in?</p>

<p>I should have faith in things that make my life better. I should give tribute to good gods, and deny the evil. But not all of the gods I give tribute to are good. I give tribute to mindless consumption, pride, and hedonism.</p>

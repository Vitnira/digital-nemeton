I" <p>Many years ago I’d regularly have lunch with a consistent group of coworkers in the breakroom and we would discuss all manner of things. One week’s ‘theme’ ended up being history. I’ll never forget what one coworker said.</p>

<p>“Why care about history? What does it, like, do? It’s not useful. It’s just a bunch of trivia.”</p>

<p>This caught me incredibly off guard. I’m not great on my feet in conversations so I let others pick up the slack, but their arguments…sucked. Here’s one:
“We’ve learned construction from studying Roman concrete, and Damascus forging.”
“It’s not worth all that historical funding though. Why not put the money directly toward regular old materials science?”</p>

<p>These arguments are similar to theological vs atheist arguments - the research of history is not materially useful (and is not meant to be), so a Materialist argument is completely useless. Religion is not materially useful. Art, music, not materially useful. But unlike all those, history is not spiritually useful either. So what IS its use?</p>

<p>Now we’re getting to the herbivorous sauran meat of the post. Let’s talk about DINOSAURS!</p>

<p>The 90s were a time of dinosaur obsession. GIANT REPTILES! Like dragons, but REAL! AND ANCIENT! AWESOME!!!</p>

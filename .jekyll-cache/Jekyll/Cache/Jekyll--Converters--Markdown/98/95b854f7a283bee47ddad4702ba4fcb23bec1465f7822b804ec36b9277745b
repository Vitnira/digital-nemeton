I"Š<p>Those who know Vitnira from other places know that I am a polytheist. Eventually Iâ€™ll write a page describing my theological beliefs in detail, but suffice to say for now it is a balance of archetypal, jungian, and hard polytheism. Usually that amounts to â€œyouâ€™re just a LAPRing atheistâ€. If you want to believe that, you may as well stop reading here. I believe what I believe.</p>

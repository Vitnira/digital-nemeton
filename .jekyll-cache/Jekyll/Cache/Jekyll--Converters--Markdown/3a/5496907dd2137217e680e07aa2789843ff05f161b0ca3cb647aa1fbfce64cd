<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-hummus-from-jerusalem-ottolenghi">Basic Hummus from Ottolenghi</a>
(5/24/2025) Iâ€™ve made this before. Instead of cold water I used very jiggly pork bone broth (lol), bottled lemon juice, and pre-crushed garlic in a jar.
I also used canned chickpeas and boiled them with a single sliced carrot in broth for about 30min. I didnâ€™t really notice the carrot this time, but it was yummy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/broccoli-soup-recipe-8772702">Verdant Soup</a>
(April 2025) Extremely green broccoli soup. I made it unvegan, using bone broth.</p>

<h2 id="sweet">Sweet</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/sunny-lemon-bars-recipe">Stella Parksâ€™ Lemon Bars</a>
(5/24/2025) I made these with bottled lemon juice and a splash of True Citrus lime, and they came out <em>incredible</em>. Used regular flour for crust.
I cut diagonals into the parchment paper to make it fold easier for removal. I probably should have just cut it to be even with the pan.</p>

<p><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/brown-butter-pecan-pie-bars/">Brown Butter Pecan Pie Bars</a>
I made these in March 2025 with my mom. They were really good. She wasnâ€™t eating much by then, and they are <em>very</em> filling.</p>

<p><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/blueberry-galette/">Blueberry Galette</a>
Also made in March 2025 with my mom. Spectacular. She loved how easy and yummy it was.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/chocolate-mousse-recipe-7109970">Chocolate Mousse</a>
One of many reasons I want a stand mixer. Made March 2025 with my mom. She loved it.
We made another where we subbed dark chocolate for white and it came out extremely runny, so we used it as ice cream topping.</p>

<h2 id="cocktails">Cocktails</h2>

<p><a href="https://punchdrink.com/recipes/smugglers-cove-zombie/">Smugglerâ€™s Cove Zombie</a>
(5/24/2025) I love Zombies. Used Plantation OFTD, Havana Club Aged, and Plantation Xamayca. Also bottled lime juice. I am <em>very</em> lazy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/lime-posset-recipe-11731503">Lime Posset</a>
I probably want to steep the cream in earl grey or something, that sounds fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/diy-black-tahini-and-beet-hummus-recipe">Beet Hummus</a>
Probably wonâ€™t bother using the black tahini but I love beets.</p>

## Savory

[Basic Hummus from Ottolenghi](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-hummus-from-jerusalem-ottolenghi)

(5/24/2025) I've made this before. Instead of cold water I used very jiggly pork bone broth (lol), bottled lemon juice, and pre-crushed garlic in a jar.
I also used canned chickpeas and boiled them with a single sliced carrot in broth for about 30min. I didn't really notice the carrot this time, but it was yummy.

[Verdant Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/broccoli-soup-recipe-8772702)

(April 2025) Extremely green broccoli soup. I made it unvegan, using bone broth.

[Pressure Cooker Mushroom Risotto](https://www.seriouseats.com/pressure-cooker-mushroom-risotto-recipe)

(June 2025) Second time making, always a hit. So luxuriously creamy. Homemade broth and seasonal mushrooms ramp it up. And *very* easy.

Einkorn Neapolitan Pizza from Einkorn by Carla Bartolucci

(June 2025) Made twice, fantastic sourdough pizza dough. I made bianca pizza and regular tomato+mozz. Mushrooms leftover from the risotto. Absolutely wonderful.

Einkorn Rye Bread from Einkorn by Carla Bartolucci

(June 2025) Dry, crumbly, and awful. I need to look into another recipe. Blegh.

## Sweet

[Stella Parks' Lemon Bars](https://www.seriouseats.com/sunny-lemon-bars-recipe)

(5/24/2025) I made these with bottled lemon juice and a splash of True Citrus lime, and they came out *incredible*. Used regular flour for crust.
I cut diagonals into the parchment paper to make it fold easier for removal. I probably should have just cut it to be even with the pan.

[Brown Butter Pecan Pie Bars](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/brown-butter-pecan-pie-bars/)

I made these in March 2025 with my mom. They were really good. She wasn't eating much by then, and they are *very* filling.

[Blueberry Galette](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/blueberry-galette/)

Also made in March 2025 with my mom. Spectacular. She loved how easy and yummy it was.

[Chocolate Mousse](https://www.seriouseats.com/chocolate-mousse-recipe-7109970)

One of many reasons I want a stand mixer. Made March 2025 with my mom. She loved it.
We made another where we subbed dark chocolate for white and it came out extremely runny, so we used it as ice cream topping.

[Strawberry Cake](https://www.seriouseats.com/strawberry-cake-recipe)

(March 2025) I modified it slightly with ideas from the recipe on Sally's Baking Addiction. Used to make the infamous Duck Cake.

## Cocktails

[Smuggler's Cove Zombie](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/smugglers-cove-zombie/)

(5/24/2025) I love Zombies. Used Plantation OFTD, Havana Club Aged, and Plantation Xamayca. Also bottled lime juice. I am *very* lazy.


### Recipes I Want To Try

[Avgolemono Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/avgolemono-soup-greek-lemon-egg-chicken-soup)

Egg and chicken? Soup? Yes.

[Lime Posset](https://www.seriouseats.com/lime-posset-recipe-11731503)

I probably want to steep the cream in earl grey or something, that sounds fun.

[Beet Hummus](https://www.seriouseats.com/diy-black-tahini-and-beet-hummus-recipe)

Probably won't bother using the black tahini but I love beets.

[Key Lime Pie Bars](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/key-lime-pie-bars/)

I love KLP. May wait until sour orange is in season to try a variant with orange juice and gingersnap cookie crust.

[Cinnamon Roll Cake](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/giant-cinnamon-roll-cake/)

I am lazy. I like cinnamon rolls. This seems like a good in-between

[Croissant Bread](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/croissant-bread/)

I also like croissants and am lazy.

[Bierock / Runza - Beef and Cabbage Bread Dumpling](https://www.seriouseats.com/bierocks-recipe-8775361)

I fell in love with Runzas visiting Nebraska for a wedding. It's like a burger hot pocket if hot pockets were actually good.
